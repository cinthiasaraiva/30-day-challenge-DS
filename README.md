# ðŸ“Š 30-Day Data Science Challenge

Welcome to my 30-Day Data Science Challenge!
The goal: 30 minutes of practice every day for 30 days to strengthen my skills in Python, SQL, statistics, and machine learning, while building a portfolio of clean, documented projects.

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals

Refresh and deepen core data science skills

Build end-to-end ML projects (EDA â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation â†’ deployment)

Practice version control and GitHub project organization

Document progress daily for consistency and accountability

# ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/         # Daily practice notebooks (Python, SQL, Stats, ML)
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/          # End-to-end projects with README & results
â”œâ”€â”€ data/              # Example datasets (or links if too large)
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/             # Helper scripts/functions
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # This file
